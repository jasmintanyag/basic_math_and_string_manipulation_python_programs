# Prog09. index() return the first location of the function parameter in the string. Create a program that do the same functionality without using index() function.

# ask user to input a string
# ask again to input the substring to find
# initialize the index variable
# loop through the string to find the first occurrence
# check if substring matches the current position
# store the index and stop the loop
# if index is still -1, it means the substring was not found
# else, print the result if found

text = input("Enter a text: ")
substring = input("Enter the substring to find: ")
index = -1
